Armed with the resources I needed, I delved into the projects and churned out a few PRs and I was hooked. I dove aggressively into the projects and handled any curve balls with the help of my mentors. My participation in the Layer5 community drove me to a well earned obsession with open source projects which led me to make my own contributions in the FOSSASIA and GATSBY projects and take part in many open-source contests such as Hacktoberfest, DevopsCember, Kharagpur Winter Of Code (KWOC), NJACK Winter Of Code (NWOC), Girlscript Summer Of Code (GSSOC).\"), mdx(\"img\", {\n    src: pic4,\n    alt: \"github-profile\"\n  }), mdx(\"h4\", null, \"What is Meshery?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Meshery is a multi-service mesh management plane that offers lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of service meshes and applications running on top of those meshes.\", mdx(\"br\", null)), mdx(\"img\", {\n    src: pic1,\n    alt: \"meshry\"\n  }), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Meshery uses a common service mesh performance specification to describe and capture performance benchmarks and results.
