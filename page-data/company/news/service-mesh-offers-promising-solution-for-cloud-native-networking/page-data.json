Within cloud native deployments, an increasingly common approach to networking is the service mesh concept. With a service mesh, instead of each individual container requiring a full networking stack, a grouping of containers all benefit from a mesh that provides connectivity and networking with other containers as well as the outside world.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Service mesh in the wild\\nWhile the concept of a service mesh has applicability beyond just Kubernetes deployments, that's arguably where the vast majority of deployments are today.
